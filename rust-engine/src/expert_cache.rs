//! In-RAM LRU cache of resident experts.
//!
//! Each cache entry is an `Arc<ExpertResident>` whose buffer is owned by the
//! [`BufferPool`](crate::buffer_pool::BufferPool). Eviction simply drops the
//! `Arc`; once any in-flight inference also drops its handle, the underlying
//! `PooledBuffer` returns to the pool's free list automatically.
//!
//! When the on-disk expert file was produced by `gguf-convert` (its default
//! mode), the buffer starts with a 64-byte Unified Tensor Header padded out
//! to one block. [`ExpertResident::data`] transparently strips that prefix
//! so every consumer downstream sees only the bare weight payload —
//! existing code paths (the SwiGLU kernels, the cache verifier, the
//! synthetic-expert fixtures) don't need to learn about UTH.
