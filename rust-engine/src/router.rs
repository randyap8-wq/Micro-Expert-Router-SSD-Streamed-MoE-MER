//! Deterministic Markov-chain router and Markov predictive prefetcher.
//!
//! For an MoE engine whose interesting axis is **I/O**, a router that picks
//! experts uniformly at random is actively misleading: it has no temporal
//! correlation, so any prefetch policy looks worthless. Real MoE traces show
//! strong locality — once a stream wanders into a "topic", it tends to keep
//! activating the same handful of experts for many tokens. We therefore
//! model the router as a **first-order Markov chain over expert ids**.
//!
//! Two components live here:
//!
//! 1. [`TopKRouter`] picks `k` distinct expert ids per token by sampling
//!    from `P(next | last_expert)`. The transition matrix is either:
//!    * **Generated** with structured locality — experts are split into
//!      `cluster_count` groups and stay inside their group with a high
//!      probability ([`TopKRouter::clustered`]).
//!    * **Loaded** from a file containing a row-stochastic `N x N` matrix
//!      (whitespace-separated `f64` values, row-major — easy to feed real
//!      routing traces; see [`TopKRouter::from_matrix_file`]).
//!    The router is fully deterministic given a seed.
//!
//! 2. [`PredictiveLoader`] is a first-order Markov *predictor* built
//!    online from observed activations and used by the engine to issue
//!    speculative prefetches. The router is fixed; the predictor learns.

/// A two-layer MLP (`d_model -> hidden -> num_experts`) trained online
/// against the gating network's actual top-K decisions. The network is
/// kept intentionally small (default hidden = 128) so it fits in L1/L2
/// cache and so a single SGD step per token is cheap; the goal is not
/// to *replace* the gate but to provide a fast, stateless prediction of
/// "what experts will likely fire next given this hidden state" that
/// can be unioned with the Markov chain's hint to drive prefetch.
///
/// Architecture details:
/// * Layer 1: `W1` of shape `[hidden, d_model]`, bias `b1` of `hidden`,
///   ReLU activation.
/// * Layer 2: `W2` of shape `[num_experts, hidden]`, bias `b2` of
///   `num_experts`. The output is interpreted as a logit vector;
///   `predict_topk` returns the top-K ids by logit, and `train_step`
///   takes a softmax + cross-entropy step against a soft target spread
///   uniformly over the actual top-K ids selected by the real gate.
///
/// Initialisation uses He-uniform scaling (the standard ReLU init) with
/// a deterministic seed so identical runs produce identical predictions.
/// All numerical paths are `f32`. Stability is enforced by three
/// stacked safeguards: a **global L2-norm gradient cap** at
/// [`Self::MAX_GRAD_NORM`] on both `dlogits` and the back-propagated
/// `dh`, a per-element `±MAX_GRAD_NORM` clamp as a belt-and-braces
/// guard, and a `clamp_finite` check on every weight write. The
/// effective learning rate decays inverse-time against the
/// cumulative step counter (see [`Self::LR_DECAY_RATE`]) so a sudden
/// topic shift late in a long run can't dominate the model. The
/// predictor is a *prefetch hint*; correctness still flows through
/// the real gate downstream, so even a pathological speculator can
