//! Fixed-size slab pool of pre-allocated, page-aligned RAM buffers.
//!
//! The spec calls for "hot-swapping experts ... into a **pre-allocated** RAM
//! buffer". A naive implementation would `Vec::with_capacity` per cache miss,
//! which (a) is not aligned for `O_DIRECT`, (b) thrashes the allocator, and
//! (c) makes total RAM use unbounded.
//!
//! Instead, at startup we allocate `slots` aligned buffers of `expert_size`
//! bytes and hand them out as [`PooledBuffer`] guards. When a guard is dropped
//! its buffer is returned to the pool's free list — so the LRU eviction of an
//! expert automatically frees a slot for the next miss.
//!
//! # Primary / Shadow split (gist Phase 1, "zero-stall pipeline")
//!
//! When the engine wants to overlap the current token's compute with the
//! *next* token's speculative prefetch, the primary pool — which backs the
//! resident LRU — must never be raided by speculation. The pool therefore
//! supports an optional **shadow** half: a second free-list of the same
//! size buffers, served by [`BufferPool::try_acquire_shadow`]. Speculative
//! prefetches go there; on confirmation the engine calls
//! [`BufferPool::promote_shadow`] to atomically swap the shadow buffer
//! into the primary half so the cache can install it as a resident
//! without re-reading the SSD. The two halves share one [`Notify`], so
//! a `Drop` on either side wakes any waiter on the other.
