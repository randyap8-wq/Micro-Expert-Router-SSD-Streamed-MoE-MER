//! NVMe storage provider.
//!
//! Opens each expert as its own file (optionally with `O_DIRECT` on Linux),
//! keeps the file descriptors resident in an fd cache, and reads experts
//! into a [`PooledBuffer`] owned by the caller via positional reads
//! (`pread(2)`).
//!
//! ## Why this layout?
//!
//! * **One fd per expert, kept open.** Removes per-read `open()` syscalls
//!   from the steady-state latency budget — the same property an io_uring
//!   path would want with registered files.
//! * **`O_DIRECT`.** Bypasses the page cache so we measure (and consume)
//!   raw NVMe bandwidth. Required by the spec; the buffer pool guarantees
//!   the alignment invariants the kernel checks.
//! * **`block_in_place` + `pread`.** Each cache miss runs the synchronous
//!   `pread(2)` on the current Tokio worker via
//!   [`tokio::task::block_in_place`]. The worker is donated to blocking
//!   work and other ready tasks are picked up by sibling workers, so the
//!   runtime stays responsive. Using `pread` (positional) instead of
//!   `read_exact` means we do not touch the file offset and reads are
//!   safe to issue concurrently against the same fd.
//! * **Optional `--no-direct` fallback.** Useful on tmpfs / overlayfs /
//!   non-Linux CI where `O_DIRECT` returns `EINVAL`. The engine still
//!   exercises the same prefetch + LRU + alignment logic.
//!
//! ## Why not `rio`?
//!
//! Earlier drafts used the [`rio`] io_uring crate directly. `rio 0.9.4` has
//! an unfixed use-after-free advisory and the crate is unmaintained, so we
//! removed the dependency. The intended production replacement is
//! [`tokio-uring`] (or the raw `io-uring` crate with registered fixed
//! buffers); both require restructuring `main` around their own runtime
//! entry points (`tokio_uring::start`), which is left as future work. The
//! `io_provider` module is the only place that needs to change to swap
//! backends, so this is a self-contained migration.
